After creating bufr library go to station_list directory

   make
if you use Prtland compilers please specify
   make CNAME=_pgf90

There are 5 files in this directory

1) wmo_a.pl   

   Script which format ftp WMO Volume A station list
   suitable for wmo_make_station program

2) wmo_make_station

   creates binary station list station_amend.dat.
   mv station_amend.dat station_list.dat to be used by 
   synop2bufr program

3)  wmo_make_station.f  source program for 2)


4) wmo.txt input text station list for wmo_make_station program

5) important_stations.dat  read by wmo_make_station program


  Steps to be done:

 a)  ftp station list from WMO http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/ois/volume-a/vola-home.htm 

  The ftp-ed file is like Pub9volA090928.flatfile

 b)  wmo_a.pl Pub9volA090928.flatfile  outputfile


  sort -k2,2 outputfile > outputfile.1

  mv outputfile.1 wmo.txt

  edit wmo.txt ;remove the last line and save file

  If you want to add your own stations edit wmo.txt file.

  you can add station anywhere but it is important to
  sort the file upon block number ( 2 field ).

  sort -k2,2 wmo.txt > a

  move a wmo.txt

  mv a wmo.txt

 c) create binary station list 

    ./wmo_make_station

   It will create station_amend.dat which is new binary station list

   cp station_amend.dat ~PP_BASE/dat/statlion_list.dat

 d) Create station list which contains instrument height fileds as missing values
    This values has to set to proper values for each station from the Country.

    ./make_synop2bufr_station

    The input is wmo.txt and file synop2bufr_station.txt shall be created

    The last 4 fields in the synop2bufr_station.txt are heights above ground in m for:

    
    temperature
    visibility
    precipitation
    wind    


 e) Edit synop2bufr_station.txt and fill in instrument heights for above elements
    for your stations. The example is synop2bufr_station.txt.greece

    save the file and cp synop2bufr_station.txt ~PP_BASE/dat/.


 f) Make sure that binary version and text version of stations contain the same stations.

If you want to run test program before instal library and Bufr tables
just run small script:

./test.sh

that will set requered environment variables
and run: 

./synop2bufr -i data/greek.gts -o data/greek.gts.bufr -c 87
